- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mcutler88
- 👀 I’m interested in Raspberry Pi.  I start a pre-college course soon to learn programming, and hope to hone my skills to program with Python and to build robotics 
- and other cool projects using Pi.  
- 🌱 I’m currently reading the MagPi articles on projects other people have made and hope to modify/create my own in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding and building these projects.
- 📫 How to reach me:  mcutler88@msn.com
I'm also an avid home baker that likes to make desserts.
